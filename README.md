# Object Detection and Tracking System

This project is a robust object detection and tracking application that utilizes YOLO (You Only Look Once) for real-time object identification and OpenCV for object tracking. The system is designed to detect and track objects in live video streams, providing a user-friendly interface for seamless interaction and visualization.

## Features

- Real-time object detection using YOLO
- Object tracking with OpenCV
- Dynamic visualization of detected and tracked objects
- User-friendly interface for easy interaction

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **YOLO (You Only Look Once)**: Real-time object detection framework
- **OpenCV**: Library for computer vision and image processing tasks
- **Python**: Programming language used for implementation
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch**: Deep learning frameworks (if applicable)
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive development and documentation environment
- **Git**: Version control system
- **VS Code**: Integrated development environment (IDE)
- **Docker**: Containerization tool (if applicable)

## Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/object-detection-tracking.git
   cd object-detection-tracking
   ```
2. **Set Up Virtual Environment**
 ```sh
   python -m venv cv_env
   source cv_env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `cv_env\Scripts\activate`
  ```
3. **Download YOLO Weights and Config Files**
- Download the YOLO weights and config files from the official YOLO website or repository and place them in the yolo-coco directory.
4. **Run the Application**
 ```sh
Copy code
python object_detection_tracking.py
```
 ## Usage
- Run the object_detection_tracking.py script to start the object detection and tracking.
- The application will open a video stream window displaying the detected and tracked objects.
